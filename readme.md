## the real working translator for vscodevim keybinding
### Since I've tried to use the setting which vscodevim has provided that you can import your init.vim, but it turns out failed on converting all my keybinding from the insert mode. Therefore, I created this little tool for myself.

### convert your vim keybindings into the format of vscodevim keybinding 


### **Usage:**
### Windows
```vimtovscodekeybinding.exe -f [specify the path of your vim keybinding config file] ```
**or**
```vimtovscodekeybinding.exe --filepath [specify the path of your vim keybinding config file]```
### Linux
```vimtovscodekeybinding -f [specify the path of your vim keybinding config file] ```
**or**
```vimtovscodekeybinding --filepath [specify the path of your vim keybinding config file]```
## you can download the binary from [this page](https://github.com/wizenith/vscode_keybinding_from_vim/releases)
